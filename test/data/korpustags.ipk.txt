%  0. A short explanation

% The Document has two parts. 
% The first part outlines the internal structure of
% the complex POS, these should be built as boxes or panes.
% The last part is a list over the different morphosyntactic categories.

% The tags are in complementary distribution within each tag column.
% The derivation component is ignored.
