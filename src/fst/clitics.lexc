LEXICON f
<"@D.[IT]V.ON@">  # ; ! Deletes unwated iv/tv combinations

!! The philosophy behind this is that we need only one
!! derivational section:
!! verb iv or tv -> DER -> infl iv or tv -> f lexicon
!! The f lexicon then deletes iv+tv and tv+iv combinations,
!! and leaves only iv+Ã­v and tv+tv
