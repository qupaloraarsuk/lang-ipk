This is free and open source Inupiaq morphology.


 * +N +V +Part +Prop +Pron   POS
 * +Sg +Du +Pl			      Number
 * +1Sg +2Sg +3Sg +4Sg	      Intransitive number Sg
 * +1Du +2Du +3Du +4Du	      Intransitive number Du

 * +Symbol = independent symbols in the text stream, like £, €, ©

4th person still missing in the transitive conjugation

 * +Abs +Rel +Trm +Loc +Abl +Mod  Cases
 * +Prs +Prt  Tenses
 * +Ind +Int +Cau +ConReal +ConUnreal  Modes NB! No Imp
 * +Arch  tags for archaic forms. In this pilot just used to indicate twin forms

 * +LLATU +LLATU=NIAQ +NIAQ +NIAQ=ŊIT +ŊIT +SAAĠE +SAAĠE=ŊIT +TEQ  verb elaborating
 +IT +QAQ 
 * +VIK  nominalizers
 * +LU +GUUQ +UNA  clitics

 * %^TRUNC  truncation dummy
 * %^CVCTRUNC  dummy for very long truncations
 * %^VCTRUNC  dummy for long truncation
 * %^FRIC  dummy for fricativizing stem-final consonants.
Needed to avoid a general rule that also would affect unwantedly as in *aaġagu for aaqagu.
The alternative would have been to postulate truncating flexives with a fricative first consonant (*aiviq -q +ġit) but that is hokus pokus
 * %^EBLOCK  dummy to block schwa going to a (aŋutik not *aŋuttak)
 * %^C  dummy for intermediate gemination
 * %^DEFRIC  dummy when fricatives go stops (amaġuq -> amaqquk) as apposed to %C in niġi+VIK -> niġġivik
 * %^SCHWADEL  !dummy with derivatives truncating semi-final schwa

!!Flag diacritics

 * @P.IV.ON@  Flag - sets value for transitivity to IV
 * @P.TV.ON@  Flag - sets value for transitivity to TV
 * @R.IV.ON@  Flag - reset value for transitivity to IV
 * @R.TV.ON@  Flag - reset value for transitivity to TV
 * @D.IV.ON@  Flag - delete if unsaturated IV flag (=Verb was not IV)
 * @D.TV.ON@  Flag - delete if unsaturated TV flag (=Verb was not TV)


We have manually optimised the structure of our lexicon using following
flag diacritics to restrict morhpological combinatorics - only allow compounds
with verbs if the verb is further derived into a noun again:
 | @P.NeedNoun.ON@ | (Dis)allow compounds with verbs unless nominalised
 | @D.NeedNoun.ON@ | (Dis)allow compounds with verbs unless nominalised
 | @C.NeedNoun@ | (Dis)allow compounds with verbs unless nominalised

For languages that allow compounding, the following flag diacritics are needed
to control position-based compounding restrictions for nominals. Their use is
handled automatically if combined with +CmpN/xxx tags. If not used, they will
do no harm.
 | @P.CmpFrst.FALSE@ | Require that words tagged as such only appear first
 | @D.CmpPref.TRUE@ | Block such words from entering ENDLEX
 | @P.CmpPref.FALSE@ | Block these words from making further compounds
 | @D.CmpLast.TRUE@ | Block such words from entering R
 | @D.CmpNone.TRUE@ | Combines with the next tag to prohibit compounding
 | @U.CmpNone.FALSE@ | Combines with the prev tag to prohibit compounding
 | @P.CmpOnly.TRUE@ | Sets a flag to indicate that the word has passed R
 | @D.CmpOnly.FALSE@ | Disallow words coming directly from root.

Use the following flag diacritics to control downcasing of derived proper
nouns (e.g. Finnish Pariisi -> pariisilainen). See e.g. North Sámi for how to use
these flags. There exists a ready-made regex that will do the actual down-casing
given the proper use of these flags.
 | @U.Cap.Obl@ | Allowing downcasing of derived names: deatnulasj.
 | @U.Cap.Opt@ | Allowing downcasing of derived names: deatnulasj.


This file gives the start  of the Iñupiaq lexicon.
The lexicon Root points at the different parts of speech.
Each POS has its own file stems/nouns.lexc, etc., which in
turn points to affixes/nouns.lexc, etc.
POS-changing nominalizers are found in affixes/verbs.lexc and
verbalizers in affixes/nouns.lexc
It might be a good idea to have noun-ipk-der.txt etc. as well.
The common, final lexica, are found in clitics.lexc.
